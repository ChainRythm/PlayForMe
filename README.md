# PlayForMe

AI that plays games for you..... hopefully

I want to learn to code and what better way than to, well, code.
the only thing i could think of making was a Bot that would play games for me,
but i want it to learn to play the game/s so thats why im calling it AI.

Staring from zero would be too much for a total noob so im using Jarvis from "ValentinGenard/Jarvis-artificial-intelligence"
as a baseline... dont know if it will work but here we go. 

Note to ValentGenard, if you're reading this, i have no idea what im doing.... lol and thanks for the code?
